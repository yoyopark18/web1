  <h1>WEB이란 무엇인가</h1>
  <p>
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
system where documents and other web resources are identified
by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/),
which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible
over the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW are transfered
via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed
by users by a software application called a web browser and are
published by a software application called a web server.
